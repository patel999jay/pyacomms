This repo is base on the old pyAcomms repo which is originally written for the python2. I converted the package to python3. 
If you want to contribute, please clone the repo and then make a pull request. 

pyAcomms provides a Python interface to Micromodem and Micromodem-2 hardware from the
`Acoustic Communications Group <http://acomms.whoi.edu/>`_ at the `Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution <http://www.whoi.edu/>`_.

See examples in the ``/examples`` and ``/bin`` directories.
